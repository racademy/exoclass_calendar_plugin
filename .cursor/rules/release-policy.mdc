# CRITICAL RELEASE POLICY

**NEVER** commit code or create releases unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Rules:
- Do NOT run `git commit` unless user specifically asks
- Do NOT run `git push` unless user specifically asks  
- Do NOT create version tags unless user specifically asks
- Do NOT create GitHub releases unless user specifically asks
- User will decide when to commit and when to make releases
- Always wait for user's explicit instruction before any git operations

## When making changes:
- Make code changes as requested
- Show the changes to user
- Wait for user to decide when to commit/release
- User will write when release should be made

This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT and must ALWAYS be followed.
