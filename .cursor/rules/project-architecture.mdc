```

## Key Components

### Main Plugin Class (ExoClassCalendar)
- Handles WordPress hooks and shortcode registration
- Manages AJAX endpoints for API communication
- Enqueues scripts and styles conditionally

### Admin Settings
- WordPress admin interface for plugin configuration
- API endpoint and provider key management
- Plugin settings and customization options

### Frontend Calendar
- FullCalendar.js integration with custom event rendering
- Real-time filtering by location, activity, age group, difficulty
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Lithuanian localization support

### API Integration
- Server-side proxy for ExoClass API calls
- Data transformation and caching
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Development Workflow
1. Test changes locally using WordPress development environment
2. Validate API integration with ExoClass test endpoints
3. Ensure mobile responsiveness across devices
4. Verify Lithuanian localization and timezone handling
5. Test plugin activation/deactivation procedures

## Key Dependencies
- **WordPress**: Core platform (5.0+)
